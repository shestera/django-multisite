        Filters the foreignkey queryset for fields referencing other models

        (if they aren't a superuser), and (optionally) belonging to the same
        site as the current object.

        Also prevents (non-super) users from assigning objects to sites that
        they are not members of.

        If the foreign key does not have a site/sites field directly, you can
        specify a path to a site/sites field to filter on by setting the key:

            - multisite_foreign_key_site_path

        foreign key named 'plan' having a foreign key to 'site'.

        To filter the FK queryset to the same sites the current object belongs
        to, simply set `filter_sites_by_current_object` to `True`.

        Caveats:

        1) If you're adding an object that belongs to a site (or sites),
        and you've set `self.limit_sites_by_current_object = True`,
        then the FK fields to objects that also belong to a site won't show
        any objects. This is due to filtering on an empty queryset.
